# Softlink establish a master-slave relationship. They act as a pointer that simply redirects to the original file location.
# If the original file's deleted or moved, the Softlink will be broken.

# Hardlink create a new directory entry that point to the same inode on the disk, and all changes made through any of these linked files are instantly synchronized.
# The file's data will only be truly deleted from disk when all hardlinks pointing to it are deleted.

# To create a symlink:
ln -s <source-location> <symlink-location>

# To symlink, while overwriting existing destination files
ln -sf <source-location> <symlink-location>
